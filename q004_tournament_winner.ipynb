    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a list of competitions and their results, determine the team that wins the tournament. The input consists of a list where each element is a pair representing a match between two teams, and a results array where a win is denoted by a `1` or a `0`. A `1` indicates that the home team (first in the pair) won, while a `0` indicates the away team (second in the pair) won. Each competition in the list has a corresponding result in the results array.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function should return the name of the team that has the most wins at the end of the tournament.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**  \n",
    "`competitions = [[\"HTML\", \"C#\"], [\"C#\", \"Python\"], [\"Python\", \"HTML\"]]`  \n",
    "`results = [0, 0, 1]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:** `\"Python\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "Here, Python wins against C# and then HTML, accumulating the most wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**  \n",
    "`competitions = [[\"HTML\", \"Java\"], [\"Java\", \"Python\"], [\"Python\", \"HTML\"]]`  \n",
    "`results = [0, 1, 1]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:** `\"Python\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "Python defeats Java and HTML in succession, thus having the most wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `1 <= competitions.length <= 100`\n",
    "- Each competition consists of two different teams.\n",
    "- Each team name consists of upper or lowercase English letters.\n",
    "- The results array will be the same length as the competitions array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Follow-up:\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you implement an efficient solution with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of competitions?"
